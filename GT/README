The GUI can be run by running "main.py". In order to run the GUI
PyQt5 must be installed by using "pip install PyQt5". Your Python
installation must also contain: numpy, matplotlib, os, sys and json.

The GUI will allow the user to generate a model that will make a live
plot with the generations on the x-axis and the maximum payoff of that
specific generation on the y-axis. The GUI also allows the user to change
the parameters to their liking to experimemnt with different mutation factors,
payoff tables, generation amounts, rounds per game, poule size and seed.

The GUI also contains two check boxes: "Character plot" and "Strategies result"
Character plot: when this option is checked, the "character" of the top 20 random
strategies will be evaluated and plotted.

Strategies result: Will run the best evolved random strategy against the 10 standard
strategies in strategy.py. The strategies and their respective payoff will be plotted
in the form of a bar graph.
